stat.measures{SIRIUS}

For what can I use it?

This R function calculates a set of global of statistical measures that can be applied to characterize time-series data, such as trend, seasonality, serial correlation, non-linear autoregressive structure, periodicity, skewness (i.e., distribution symmetry coefficient), kurtosis (i.e., heavy-tailed distribution coefficient) as well as measures of chaotic dynamics (i.e., Lyapunov Exponent).

These global measures can be then used to perform clustering (e.g., self-organizing maps) on time-series data to discern differences or find similarities between the time series.

Usage and Arguments: 
stat.measures(x)

x                                            a numeric vector or univariate time series that statistical measures should be computed for. Generaly, this should be an object of class "ts" with a frequency of at least one.



Details: 

The following measures are calculated:



Sample Skewness



If x contains missing values and these are not removed, the skewness is NA. Otherwise, for a sample of n values, x_i the ith values of x, mu for their mean, s for their standard deviation, then sample skewness is b_1 = m_3 / s^3 , 

with m_3 = ∑_i (x_i - mu)^3 /n) for the sample third central moment about the mean, and s^3 = (∑_i (x_i - mu)^2 /n-1)^(3/2) . The skewness measure is unbiased under normality.




Sample Kurtosis

If x contains missing values and these are not removed, the kurtosis is NA. Otherwise, for a sample of n values, x_i the ith values of x, mu for their mean, s for their standard deviation, then sample kurtosis is g_1 = m_4 / m_2^2 -3, 

with m_4 = ∑_i (x_i - mu)^3 /n) for the 4th sample moment about the mean, and m_2 = ∑_i (x_i - mu)^2 /n) for the 2nd sample moment about the mean.



First Order Euclidean Distance

If x contains missing values and these are not removed, the euclidean distance is NA. Otherwise, for a sample of n values, x_i the ith values of x, mu for their mean, s for their standard deviation, then sample kurtosis is g_1 = m_4 / m_2^2 -3, 

with m_4 = ∑_i (x_i - mu)^3 /n) for the 4th sample moment about the mean, and m_2 = ∑_i (x_i - mu)^2 /n) for the 2nd sample moment about the mean.
